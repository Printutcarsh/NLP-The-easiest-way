# NLP-The-easiest-way
This will work as a tutorial for all the beginners who are doing the Natural Language Processing task for the first time. Whole code is explained and I have used the simplest method which will make things clear regarding NLP.
## Data information
Each sample in the train and test set has the following information:
<ul>
  <li>The text of a tweet</li>

  <li>A keyword from that tweet (although this may be blank!)</li>

  <li>The location the tweet was sent from (may also be blank)</li> 
</ul>
## Task
We are predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0.
